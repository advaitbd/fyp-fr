| 2 | denial_of_service | 0.20 | claim, verifyProof |

## Detailed Analysis

### Vulnerability #1: business_logic

**Confidence:** 0.20

**Reasoning:**

The owner of this contract is allowed to update the merkleRoot at any time via the setMerkleRoot function. This administrative power means that the owner (or an attacker who gains control of the owner key) could set a merkleRoot that does not include valid claims. In turn, legitimate recipients would be unable to prove their eligibility and claim their tokens, leaving funds permanently locked or at least unusable in the contract. Although this may be intended for flexibility (to update or correct the merkle tree), it also presents a potential centralized point of failure or abuse if misused.

**Validation:**

The ability to update the merkleRoot through the setMerkleRoot function is an intentional feature, allowing the contract owner to change the airdrop conditions if needed. Although this means the owner has the power to modify eligibility criteria, it fits the intended business model of an airdrop contract where the administrator is trusted. This does not present an exploitable flaw from the perspective of an external attacker.

**Code Snippet:**

```solidity
function setMerkleRoot(bytes32 _merkleRoot) external onlyOwner {
        merkleRoot = _merkleRoot;
    }

function claim(
        uint96 nonce,
        address receiver,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 payout,
        bytes32[] calldata proof
    ) external {
        bytes32 leaf = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(nonce, receiver, amount));

        require(payouts[leaf] + payout <= amount, "Not enough eligible amount");

        require(verifyProof(proof, merkleRoot, leaf), "Invalid proof");

        payouts[leaf] += payout;

        token.safeTransfer(receiver, payout);

        emit Claimed(receiver, amount, leaf);
    }
```

**Affected Functions:** setMerkleRoot, claim

### Vulnerability #2: denial_of_service

**Confidence:** 0.20

**Reasoning:**

The verifyProof function iterates over an array of proof elements provided by the caller. While typical Merkle proofs have a small fixed size, the function accepts an arbitrarily long proof array from calldata. In a worst-case scenario an attacker (or even an unwary user) could supply an extremely large proof, causing the claim transaction to run out of gas. This would only affect the sender of the transaction since gas is paid upfront, but it could also be used to trigger DoS in situations where claim calls are automated or if required within a batch process.

**Validation:**

The claim function performs the expected operations: it verifies the supplied Merkle proof, ensures that the cumulative claim does not exceed the predefined amount, and then transfers tokens using SafeERC20. There is no inherent denial-of-service mechanism here; the only possible external dependency is the ERC20 token contract, which is assumed to follow a standard interface. The reported DoS issue does not present a practical risk under normal conditions.

**Code Snippet:**

```solidity
function claim(
        uint96 nonce,
        address receiver,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 payout,
        bytes32[] calldata proof
    ) external {
        bytes32 leaf = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(nonce, receiver, amount));

        require(payouts[leaf] + payout <= amount, "Not enough eligible amount");

        require(verifyProof(proof, merkleRoot, leaf), "Invalid proof");

        payouts[leaf] += payout;

        token.safeTransfer(receiver, payout);

        emit Claimed(receiver, amount, leaf);
    }
```

**Affected Functions:** claim, verifyProof
