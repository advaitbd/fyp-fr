## Detailed Analysis

### Vulnerability #1: business_logic

**Confidence:** 0.00

**Reasoning:**

In the claim() function the eligible airdrop parameters (nonce, receiver, amount) are packed into a leaf that must be proven against the merkle root. However, the function does not enforce that the caller (msg.sender) is equal to the provided receiver. This design enables any party who possesses a valid merkle proof – which includes the intended receiver’s address – to submit a claim on that beneficiary’s behalf. In many airdrop deployments this design is acceptable (for example, to enable gas‐less claims by a third party), but if the intention was to restrict claims solely to the eligible account then this is a business logic issue that could be exploited via front‐running.

**Validation:**

The claim function appears to implement the intended airdrop logic. It uses a verified merkle proof to validate that the claimant is eligible for a specific amount, and it tracks cumulative payouts per merkle leaf such that the total payouts cannot exceed the entitled amount. Although it allows for partial claims (i.e. multiple claims to cumulatively reach the total amount), this is a common and intentional design in airdrop contracts, not a business logic flaw. No exploitable reentrancy, arithmetic, or sequence issues are apparent, and the use of fixed-length types in abi.encodePacked avoids ambiguity. Overall, the logic and state tracking are in line with expected behavior for a merkle airdrop contract.

**Code Snippet:**

```solidity
function claim(
        uint96 nonce,
        address receiver,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 payout,
        bytes32[] calldata proof
    ) external {
        bytes32 leaf = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(nonce, receiver, amount));

        require(payouts[leaf] + payout <= amount, "Not enough eligible amount");

        require(verifyProof(proof, merkleRoot, leaf), "Invalid proof");

        payouts[leaf] += payout;

        token.safeTransfer(receiver, payout);

        emit Claimed(receiver, amount, leaf);
    }
```
